LuvMotion
=========

LuvMotion is a library that combines [Luvia](https://github.com/yuripourre/luvia) (3D Engine) and [E-Motion](https://github.com/yuripourre/e-motion) (Image Processing).

Luvia is used to create fake 3D scenes to test some E-Motion Filters aiming in Augmented Reality.


## Screenshot

The image below shows the fake scene at the left-top corner of the image, created using JOGL.

The 2D Marks and texts was made using [glg2d](https://github.com/brandonborkholder/glg2d).

The vector was created/calculated using [E-Motion](https://github.com/yuripourre/e-motion)'s posit algorithm with Angle and Axis params.
